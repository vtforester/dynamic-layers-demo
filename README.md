**ArcGIS Online** will be [retiring](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgisonline-content/#/Changes_to_demographic_layers/011q00000033000000/) it's existing cached demographic layers and moving to a new service, [http://demographics1.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/USA_Demographics_and_Boundaries/MapServer](http://demographics1.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/USA_Demographics_and_Boundaries/MapServer), which requires an AGOL subscription. The new service *will* consume credits.

If you are swapping out the old cached service for this new one there are a couple of additional steps to consume the service. This repository holds a sample application that demonstrates one way to consume the new service.
